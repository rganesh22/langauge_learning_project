[TASK COMPLETION VERIFICATION]
You have indicated that you want to FINISH. Before I accept this, please verify:

**Original Task:** {task}

**Your Completion Summary:** {completion_summary}

**Plan Status:** {plan_status}

**Verification Checklist:**
1. Have I FULLY completed every part of the original task?
2. Did I actually execute all necessary actions (not just plan them)?
3. Did I validate any lessons I created using validate_lesson?
4. Did I load any created lessons into the database using load_lesson_to_db?
5. Are ALL plan steps marked as "complete"? If not, I MUST complete them first.
6. Are there any edge cases or requirements I overlooked?

⚠️ CRITICAL: If ANY plan steps are NOT marked as "complete", you MUST continue working.
Use mark_step_complete to update steps as you finish them.
Use get_plan_status to verify all steps are complete.

**If you realize you're not actually done:**
- Continue working with Thought -> Action
- Complete the remaining work
- Mark remaining plan steps as complete

**If you are CERTAIN everything is done AND all plan steps are complete:**
- Respond with: Finish: [brief confirmation that all requirements are met]

This is your ONE verification check. Your next Finish: will be accepted immediately.
