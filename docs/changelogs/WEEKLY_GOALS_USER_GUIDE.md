## What's New?

The Daily Goals feature has been upgraded to **Weekly Goals**! You can now plan your language learning schedule for the entire work week (Monday through Friday).

## How to Set Weekly Goals

### Step 1: Open Profile Tab
Navigate to the Profile tab at the bottom of the app.

### Step 2: Find Weekly Goals Section

You'll see:

- **Bottom**: Activity buttons (Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking, Conversation)

To add an activity:
1. Find the activity row you want (e.g., "Reading")
2. Click the **+** button under the day you want to add it to
3. A colored badge will appear in that day's column

**Example**: Want to do 2 reading activities on Monday?
- Click the + button under Monday in the Reading row
- Click it again
- You'll see a badge with "2" on it

### Step 4: Review Your Week

Each day column shows:
- **Colored badges** for each activity scheduled
- **Language icon** showing which language (e.g., ಕ for Kannada)
- **Activity icon** showing the type (book, headset, mic, etc.)
- **Number** showing how many times

**Tap any badge** to remove/reduce the count.

### Step 5: Save

Click the blue "Save Weekly Goals" button at the bottom.
