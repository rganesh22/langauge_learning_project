- Add weekends later

### 2. **Be Realistic**
- Consider your schedule
- Morning person? More Monday activities
- Busy Wednesdays? Lighter goals
- Weekends for catching up

### 3. **Mix It Up**
- Don't do just reading every day
- Balance all skills:
  - Input: Reading, Listening
  - Output: Speaking, Writing
  - Practice: Conversation

### 4. **Use Weekends Wisely**
- Light maintenance (1 activity)
- Catch up on missed weekday goals
- Or rest completely!

### 5. **Multiple Languages**
If learning multiple languages:
- Dedicate days to specific languages
- OR mix activities each day
- Example:
  - Mon: Kannada focus
  - Tue: Hindi focus
  - Wed: Mixed day

### 6. **Track and Adjust**
- Check Weekly Overview regularly
- If you're not meeting goals: reduce them
- If goals are too easy: increase them
- Adjust based on real performance
