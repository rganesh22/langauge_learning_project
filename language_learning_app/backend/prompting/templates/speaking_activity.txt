Generate a {language} speaking activity.

{script_requirement}

NO markdown (**, *, backticks), NO code fences. Output pure {language} text only in the appropriate script.

IMPORTANT: The user's current CEFR level is {user_cefr_level}. Tailor the speaking topic complexity and expected response difficulty to be appropriate for this level.

SELECTED TOPIC: {selected_topic}

{learned_section}

{learning_section}

Instructions:
1) Generate a creative activity name in {language} (using the correct script as specified above). Keep it under 200 characters, descriptive of the topic "{selected_topic}", and avoid quotes or brackets.
2) Create an interesting, engaging, and thought-provoking speaking prompt about "{selected_topic}". CRITICAL: The prompt MUST naturally incorporate ALL the required words listed in the required words section above. The prompt should be:
   - Appropriate for {user_cefr_level} level learners - adjust complexity and expectations accordingly
   - Open-ended enough to allow for natural, extended speech (encourage 2-5 minutes of speaking, not limited to 1-3 minutes)
   - Targeted and specific enough to guide meaningful conversation (avoid overly broad topics)
   - Interesting and relevant to real-life situations, personal experiences, or current events
   - Designed to encourage the user to express their thoughts, feelings, opinions, and experiences authentically
   - Written as a clear, direct prompt/question in {language} (using the correct script) that invites personal reflection and detailed response
   - Specifically chosen so that ALL required words can be naturally used when speaking about this topic (the topic should create a context where these words fit naturally)
3) Create 4-6 specific tasks/requirements that the user must satisfy in their speech. Each task should be:
   - Written ONLY in {language} using the correct script
   - A clear, actionable requirement that guides the user's speech (e.g., "Describe your experience", "Express your opinion", "Give an example" - but in {language})
   - Appropriate for {user_cefr_level} level learners
   - Something that encourages extended speaking (not limited to 1-2 sentences - allow for natural elaboration)
   - Encouraging use of vocabulary words from the word bank
   - Varied in nature (mix of description, opinion, examples, personal stories, etc.)

4) {usage_instruction}
5) {learning_instruction}
6) Do NOT include any markdown or formatting symbols (no **, *, backticks, bullets, numbers).

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown wrappers) in this exact format:
{{
    "activity_name": "short {language} name for the activity in the correct script",
    "topic": "the speaking topic/prompt in {language} using the correct script (a clear question or statement to speak about)",

    ],
