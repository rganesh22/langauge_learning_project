Generate a speaker profile for a {language} language learning activity.

Regional Dialect: {selected_region}

Language Style: {formality_instruction}

Formality Level: {formality_level}

Voice Gender: {voice_gender}

Instructions:
1. Create a realistic speaker profile appropriate for the regional dialect and formality level.
2. All fields must be in {language} script only - NO English, NO Latin letters (except for JSON field names, gender value, and formality value).
3. The speaker should match the regional dialect and formality level specified.
4. Gender MUST be ONLY the native word for "{voice_gender}" in the native script - nothing else, no additional text.
5. Formality MUST be ONLY the word "{formality_level}" - nothing else, no additional text.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON. All text values must be in {language} script except gender and formality. NO English in other values, NO Latin letters in other values, NO markdown.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
    "name": "{language} name in native script",
    "gender": "{voice_gender} in native script",
    "age": "age range in native script (e.g., 25-35)",
    "city": "city name in native script",
    "state": "state/province name in native script",
    "country": "country name in native script",
    "dialect": "dialect description in native script",
    "background": "profession/background in native script",
    "formality": "{formality_level} in native script"
}}

IMPORTANT:
- Name should be a realistic name in {language} appropriate for the gender
- Age should be appropriate for the formality level (formal = older, informal = younger)
- City should match the regional dialect
- State/province should be the state/province name in {language} script
- Country should be the country name in {language} script
- Dialect description should match the selected region
- Background/profession should be appropriate for the region and formality level
- All other text values must be in pure {language} script only
