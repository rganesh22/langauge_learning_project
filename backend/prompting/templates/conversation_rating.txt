Evaluate a {language} language learning conversation.

CRITICAL: All output must be in {language}'s native script ONLY. NO English words, NO Latin letters, NO markdown (**, *, backticks), NO code fences. Only pure {language} text.
SPECIAL FOR URDU: If {language} is "Urdu", write ALL feedback and content in Devanagari script (देवनागरी लिपि), NOT in Perso-Arabic/Urdu script.
The frontend application will transliterate from Devanagari to Perso-Arabic Urdu for display purposes.

IMPORTANT: The user's current CEFR level is {user_cefr_level}. Evaluate the conversation according to this level and provide feedback appropriate for {user_cefr_level} level learners.

Topic: {topic}

Conversation Transcript:
{conversation_transcript}

Tasks (user should complete these tasks):
{tasks_list}
{learned_context}{learning_context}

Instructions:
1. Evaluate the conversation and provide feedback in {language}'s native script appropriate for {user_cefr_level} level.

2. For each task, determine if the user completed it.

3. Provide scores from 0-100 for vocabulary usage, grammar accuracy, naturalness, and task completion.

4. Provide simple, clear, and constructive feedback in {language}'s native script. Feedback should have two parts:
   - General feedback: Overall assessment of the conversation (2-3 sentences)
   - Targeted feedback: Specific feedback for each task (what was good if completed, what to improve if not completed)

5. All feedback must be ONLY in {language}'s native script - NO English words, NO Latin letters, or NO English examples.

6. Use \\n\\n for paragraph breaks.

Return ONLY JSON in this exact format:
{
    "score": 85,
    "vocabulary_score": 90,
    "grammar_score": 80,
    "fluency_score": 85,
    "task_completion_score": 90,
    "general_feedback": "General feedback in {language} native script (2-3 sentences). Use \\n\\n for paragraph breaks.",
    "targeted_feedback": "Targeted feedback in {language} native script. Specific feedback for each task.",
    "task_assessment": {
        "task_0": {"completed": true, "feedback": "Task 1 feedback in {language} native script"},
        "task_1": {"completed": true, "feedback": "Task 2 feedback in {language} native script"},
        "task_2": {"completed": false, "feedback": "Task 3 feedback in {language} native script"}
    }
}

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- All feedback text must be in pure {language} native script only
- All task assessment feedback must be in {language} native script only
- NO English words, NO Latin letters, NO English examples, or NO English explanations
- Scores are numbers (0-100), feedback is {language} text
- If user used English words in conversation, suggest writing them in {language} script, but do NOT repeat the English words
